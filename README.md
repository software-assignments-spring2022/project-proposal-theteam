# Project Proposal

## Movie Collection
Movie collector can act as a collection of films which can be displayed as 3x3 matrix of posters on the website and provide basic information about the film when clicked on. It allows people to create a collection of films that they want to watch or an all time favourite list that they can share with friends.

## For whom
Movie collection is for people who loves watching movies and want to make a list of movies about their favourites or a list of movies that they intend to watch in the future.

## How
Movie collection allows users to add movies information in the web app and display their posters. When clicking on the poster, it will open up another window which displays brief information about the film including cast and descriptions.

## Scope
Movie collection is a bit easy for a team with 4-6 programmers as it mostly require react to seprate the web app into components which each programmer can handdle from the page display the posters to the page with individual information. An API from a third party website is required to retrive all the movie details including posters and MongoDB is used to store all the data for each user.
